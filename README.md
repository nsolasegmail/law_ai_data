# Harvey Analytics dbt Project

## üéØ **Power User Analytics**

This dbt project identifies and analyzes **Power Users** - the most valuable and engaged users of Harvey's AI-powered legal assistant platform.

## üìã **Data Assumptions**

### **Data Source Assumptions:**
- **users.csv**: **Daily updates** - user data can be refreshed daily with potential role changes, promotions, or new user additions
- **events.csv**: **Daily updates** - event logs arrive daily with real-time user activity, feedback scores, and document processing
- **firms.csv**: **Daily updates** - firm data can be refreshed daily with potential changes to firm size, ARR, mergers, acquisitions, or new firm additions

### **Data Quality Assumptions:**
- User roles may change over time (promotions, role changes, departures)
- Firm attributes (size, ARR, structure) may change daily due to business dynamics
- Events are timestamped accurately and arrive within 24 hours
- No duplicate events for the same user-firm-event combination
- All data sources maintain referential integrity

### **Business Logic Assumptions:**
- Power users are defined by the scoring formula: `0.4 √ó Active Days + 0.3 √ó Document Volume + 0.3 √ó Feature Breadth`
- Firm health is assessed based on feedback scores and user engagement patterns
- User engagement levels are frequency-based classifications (High/Mid/Low Frequency User)
- Daily processing ensures real-time insights for business decision making

## üèÜ **Power User Definition**

**Power Users** are identified using a comprehensive scoring system that evaluates three key dimensions:

### **Power Score Formula:**
```
Power Score = 0.4 √ó Active Days Weight + 0.3 √ó Document Volume Weight + 0.3 √ó Feature Breadth Weight
```

### **Score Components:**

#### **1. Active Days Weight (40% of total score)**
- **100 points**: 20+ active days per month
- **80 points**: 15-19 active days per month  
- **60 points**: 10-14 active days per month
- **40 points**: 5-9 active days per month
- **20 points**: 2-4 active days per month
- **0 points**: 0-1 active days per month

#### **2. Document Volume Weight (30% of total score)**
- **100 points**: 100+ documents processed per month
- **80 points**: 50-99 documents processed per month
- **60 points**: 25-49 documents processed per month
- **40 points**: 10-24 documents processed per month
- **20 points**: 5-9 documents processed per month
- **0 points**: 0-4 documents processed per month

#### **3. Feature Breadth Weight (30% of total score)**
- **100 points**: Uses all 3 event types (ASSISTANT, VAULT, WORKFLOW)
- **70 points**: Uses 2 event types
- **40 points**: Uses 1 event type
- **0 points**: No event activity

### **Power User Tiers:**
